# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
First I began with the HTML skeleton;
Then I linked the necessary stylesheets for fonts as well as my CSS;
Next I created titles as well as headings;
Then I made a lot of divs all with the same classes to maintain organization;
Within the divs I added all the necessary buttons in addition to its class/styles;
Next I made a footer to make the format a little more how I wanted it;
Then I linked my scripts at the bottom;
Next I started my styling and used the classes I created on my HTML page to link specifically where I wanted them;
After I began the javascript and started by outting a current date below the header;
Then I save button to record the response and input it to local storage;
Finally, I created a function to highlight the past dates, current dates, and future dates, which does not work.
